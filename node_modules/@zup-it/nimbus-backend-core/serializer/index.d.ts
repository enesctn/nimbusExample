 * Transforms the entire Component tree into the JSON format expected by Nimbus.

 * - Components become `{ '_:component': 'namespace:name', ... }`.
 * - Actions become `{ '_:action': 'namespace:name', ... }`.
 * - State declarations become `{ ..., state: { id: 'statePath', value: 'rootStateValue' } }`.
 * - References to states become: `"@{statePath}"`.
 * - Operations become: `"@{operationName(arguments)}"`.
 *
 * Attention: when in development mode, this function will also validate the component tree. To stop running the
 * validations, set NODE_ENV to something different than 'development'. To add validations to your own components,
 * use `componentValidation.add`.
 *
 * The validations are run after the JSX elements are translated to JS and before each component is serialized.
 *
 * @param componentTree the component tree to serialize
 * @returns the JSON string
